Only the files required for the fixed Reed-Solomon codec, i.e.
encode_rs_8 and decode_rs_8, have been copied here from libfec.

ccsds_tab.c is precalculated and the library does not need any initialization
when using the fixed codec.

Precalculated tables have been changed to const to keep them in program
memory ("text"), so they don't waste the RAM used for "data" section.
